    <h3> Band Member Bios</h3>
    <h4> Mina Syed</h4>
        <p> Mina Syed was born and raised in Houston, Texas. She fell in love with music the moment she listened to "Heart Attack" by Demi Lovto, and she immediatly bought an electric guitar after listening to it. She says the only time she can quiet her mind is when her hands are on her guitar. </p>
    <h4>Dani Daza</h4>
        <p>Dani Daza brings the funk to the band. She loves jamming with her girls, and the fact that there is a paycheck and a crowd is just the cherry on top. She has always played electric keyboard, but she has recently dabbled in the drums.</p>
    <h4>Cecil Beja</h4>
        <p>Cecil Beja is known for her high amount of knowledge on music. She has read every music book out there, and she draws inspriation from the classics. She is what makes this band timeless.</p>
